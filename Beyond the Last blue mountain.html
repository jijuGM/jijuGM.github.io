Ratan Tata is one of the most prominent business leaders of India. Despite running one of India’s largest conglomerates, he is greatly known for this generosity and kindness. He has always prioritized social and employee welfare before financial gains.
He oversaw the Tata Group, which includes approximately 100 companies with a combined sale of more than USD 67 billion. Under Tata’s incredible regime, the Tata Group scaled great heights, with sales and profits increasing over 50 times. Let’s have a look at his life narrative and explore the inspiring journey of Ratan Tata
Ratan Tata was born in Mumbai, during the British Raj on 28th December 1937 to Naval and Sooni Tata. His parents belonged to one of the wealthiest business families in India, the Tata Group. The Tata family played a huge role in the industrial development of India post-independence. 

Tata spent most of his childhood in India, under the care of his maternal grandmother after his parents’ divorce. He studied at the Campion School, Mumbai till eight grade. He then studied at Cathedral and John Connon School in Mumbai, the Bishop Cotton School in Shimla before moving to the United states for higher education. He graduated high-school from Riverdale Country School in New York City. He earned a management degree from Harvard University after studying architecture and structural engineering at Cornell University.

Despite becoming the future chairman of Tata Group, he began his career with blue-collar workers in the Tata Steel Division. In 1971, He was named Director-in-Charge of the National Radio and Electronics Company Limited (NELCO) when it was in desperate need of a resurrection, and he turned it around.

He took over the leadership of Tata Group in 1990, ushering in a slew of reforms to modernize the group’s business operations in order to compete successfully in the new era. During his tenure, he merged all Tata firms, purchased other companies such as Tetley and Jaguar Land Rover, and floated Tata Motors on the New York Stock Exchange, earning the company international acclaim.

Under his leadership, India acquired its first indigenously built automobile, the ‘Indica,’ as well as its first tiny car, the ‘Nano.’ As the world’s most economic automobile, the nano was designed specifically for nuclear families.
